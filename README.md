This project is an app allowing to detect simple objects depending on the ML model that is added in the app. It is part of a school project to discover app creation and ML models creation.
 
The app is coded in Kotlin and is inspired by a project made by Aarohi Singla, which can be found on GitHub. The ML models are imported using tflite
